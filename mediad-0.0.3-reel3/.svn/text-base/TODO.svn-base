+ add support to dmh archive not to use track<nr> with dmh-dvds that only support one track. Do this by looking home many tracks are there. In case only one track is there skip the episode stuff
+ what to do with deviced that are added and in autostart while another media is currently played. Easiest is to do nothing, else ask whether it should be started.
+ when a media is inserted it should not overwrite the other current device, therefor devices should not be global but should be assigned to a specific plugin
+ change videodir reloading while removing device to be only executed with device that has currently relinked recording dir
+ add mediamanager's service interface to allow plugins to tell whether they are finished
+ add image plugin support
+ add support for music


Already done:
+ check fstab to find out whether a device is mounted vi fstab
