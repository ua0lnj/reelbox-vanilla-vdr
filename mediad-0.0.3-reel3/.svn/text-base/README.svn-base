Description:

This PlugIn tries to identify the type of media inserted by removeable devices like 
like CD-ROM/DVD or USB sticks. If the type of media gets recognized and an appropriate 
plugIn is installed, mediad tries to start the plugin. If you have a 
VDR directory structure on that disc, it launches VDR's own Recording Menu. 
This also works if you have the MPEG-files stored directly in the root of the 
disc, starting with 001.vdr. In addition to that dmh-archive-dvds can either 
be displayed as a dvd (if you have the dvd plugin installed) or you can simply 
display it as a normal recoding in the recordings menu.

Note that this plugin controls other plugins as well. This means it can
start a onetrack-VCD on the fly, even if the VCD-PlugIn displays a menu 
before you can play-back. This also applies to Audio-CD's and MP3-CD's. 

You will need to provide a mount.sh Script, which must react to the commands 
mount, unmount, eject and status, like in "mount.sh status /cdrom". All 
those commands return 0 on success (e.g. the disc is mounted or correctly
ejected) and 1 on failure. You can take the script from the MP3-plugIn by
Stefan Huelswitt. A copy of this script is placed in the examples directory.

Requirements:

+ D-BUS > 0.61 at http://dbus.freedesktop.org/
+ HAL Daemon > 0.5.7 at http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/hal
+ pmount > 0.9.13 at http://www.piware.de/projects.shtml

To enable cdfs with pmount to you have to apply the following patch (atleast with 0.9.13):

If we are lucky this will be include in future versions :-)

According to your system's configuration it might be neccessary to change the
include und library pathes of the Makefile to compile correctly.

Installation:

Let's say mediad's version is 0.0.1 and vdr's version is 1.4.3. If you 
use anything else please exchange the version numbers appropriately (this
way I don't have to update this section all the times;) )

cd vdr-1.4.3/PLUGINS/src
tar xvfz vdr-mediad-0.0.1.tgz
ln -s mediad-0.0.1 mediad
cd ../..
make [options, if necessary] plugins

Usage:

The Plugin onyl provides one parameter that allows the usage of a different mount script. The
option -m takes the path to the alternative mount script. All volumes or devices that should be
be watched for new available media have to be provided at the vdr's 
plugin configuration path as mediad.conf. Starting with version 0.0.3 symbolic links are allowed  
for device location. For instance /dev/cdrom is a symbolic link to /dev/hdc. 

A sample file of the configuration can be found at the example directory. It has the following 
syntax:
The device/volume to look for
|        A descriptive name that is shown for the device/volume
|        |
|        |
|        |
|        |
hdc;CD-Rom;

By default mediad uses pmount to mount all kinds of devices to the /media directory. pmount is 
used to be able to use vdr as a nonpriviledged user. It is also used to be able to mount devices that
are not known to the system's fstab. It might be necessary to add the vdr user to special groups 
to be allowed to use pmount (i.e. with gentoo this is group plugdev).

Sample fstab entry:
/dev/dvd  /cdfs cdfs  ro,noauto,user,exec 0 0

At the plugin's settings each plugin that is known to mediad can be configured.
As mediad detects installed plugins automatically it is neccessary to ALWAYS ADD
MEDIAD AS THE VERY LAST PLUGIN TO VDR. All plugins that are added after mediad
will not be recognized.
Each plugin can be excluded from the detection process, so that it will not be used 
in case a matching volume is added to the system. In case more than one plugin matches 
to the added media, the user will be interactively questioned which plugin should be started.
I.e. a audio CD is added and the vdr has the cdda and ripit plugin installed, both plugins
match the requirements. As a result the user will be asked whether he wants to rip
or listen the CD.
In case only one plugin matches the user can decide whether this plugin should be started 
automatically or should he be asked for starting. This is also configured at the plugins setup. 
In case the plugin's main menu entry is not hidden all currently known volumes can be 
accessed for autodetection. All devices that have currently no media inserted are not shown.

To get rid of having to unmount devices I suggest to mount all automatically added volumes 
readonly. In addition to that is is very handy to remove the device's mount lock mechanism. 
This requires root priviledges and is therefore not part of the plugin but can be done with
the init scripts. As we use hal devices that are removed do get unmounted after the removal 
of the volume.

To unlock a device from mount lock simply add a line for each device like this as a root user:

echo 0 > /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/lock

These Media-Types should work

Video-CD     vdr-vcd 
Super-VCD    vdr-vcd
DVD          vdr-dvd
DMH-Archive-DVD          vdr-dvd
DMH-Archive-DVD          vdr itself
Photo CD     vdr-pcd
MP3 files    vdr-mp3
OGG files    vdr-mp3
Audio CD's   vdr-mp3
Audio CD's   cdda
Audio CD's   ripit
Mixed Mode   vdr-mp3
AVI files    vdr-mplayer     
VDR dirs     vdr itself
VDR files    vdr itself

Remarks:

This PlugIn is tested with vdr-1.4.7. Currently 1.5.x vdr versions are not tested.
